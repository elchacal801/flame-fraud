    "summary": "Threat actors target commercial banking customers using a multi-phase scheme that begins with search engine malvertising (poisoned ads impersonating bank login pages), transitions to vishing (phone-based social engineering impersonating bank staff), and culminates in unauthorized wire transfers to mule accounts. One bank documented approximately 10 attacks per day with six-to-seven-figure losses per successful incident. Cross-functional analysis using the CFPF framework traced the full kill chain and identified that mitigating the malvertising entry point eliminated successful ATOs for 8 months, saving the institution hundreds of thousands of dollars per day.\n\n---",

Successful logins are used to drain stored value — transferring loyalty points to actor-controlled accounts, converting rewards to gift cards, or transferring gift card balances. Loyalty points and gift cards are attractive targets because they're less monitored than bank accounts, rarely have MFA, and can be monetized quickly through resale markets. Akamai reports billions of credential stuffing attempts per year targeting financial services.",
