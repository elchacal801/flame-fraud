This threat path focuses on the \"bust-out\" variation, where a customer establishes a seemingly legitimate relationship with an institution, uses the account normally for a period, and then suddenly maximizes their credit utilization before abandoning the account.\n\n---\n\n## Threat Path Hypothesis\n\n> **Hypothesis**: A legitimate customer (or a synthetic identity acting indistinguishably from a legitimate customer) will slowly build a positive credit profile, then engage in sudden, high-velocity borrowing across multiple credit products, maximizing utilization and withdrawing cash or equivalents, with no intention of repayment.\n\n**Confidence**: High — based on established banking typologies for credit risk management and consumer fraud.\n\n**Estimated Impact**: Ranging from $5k to $100k+ per individual depending on credit limits. Often coordinated by professional bust-out rings resulting in aggregate losses in the millions.\n\n---\n\n## CFPF Phase Mapping\n\n### Phase 1: Recon\n\n| Technique | Description | Indicators |\n|-----------|-------------|------------|\n| CFPF-P1-002: Domain infrastructure | Actors study institutional credit limit increase policies, billing cycles, and over-limit tolerances. | Application velocity; repeated inquiries on credit bureau files |\n\n**Data Sources**: External credit bureau data, account opening records.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 3: Positioning\n\n| Technique | Description | Indicators |\n|-----------|-------------|------------|\n| CFPF-P3-002: Modify account information | The customer steadily pays statements, sometimes overpaying, to request credit line increases and establish a 'trusted' behavioral baseline. | Steady cadence of small purchases with full payoffs; multiple requests for credit limit increases |\n| CFPF-P3-003: Establish persistence | Contact information may be altered prior to the bust-out event to hinder collections efforts. | Changing phone numbers or addresses to VoIP lines or mail drops |\n\n**Data Sources**: Account maintenance logs, customer profiles, credit limit change requests.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 4: Execution\n\n| Technique | Description | Indicators |\n|-----------|-------------|------------|\n| CFPF-P4-001: Unauthorized wire transfer | (In this case, Authorized but fraudulent intention) User executes rapid, high-value transactions — maximizing credit cards, drawing down lines of credit, or taking cash advances. | Sudden spike in utilization ratio (e.g., from 10% to 95% in <24 hours); high-frequency cash advance activity |\n\n**Data Sources**: Transaction processing systems, ATM logs, authorization networks.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 5: Monetization\n\n| Technique | Description | Indicators |\n|-----------|-------------|------------|\n| CFPF-P5-001: Wire to domestic mule account | Cash withdrawals are deposited into untraceable assets or moved out of the financial system. Purchases of high-value resalable goods (electronics, luxury items). | Merchant category codes (MCCs) skewed toward electronics, jewelry, or cash equivalents |\n\n**Data Sources**: Transaction MCC analysis, withdrawal metadata.\n\n---\n\n## Look Left / Look Right Analysis\n\n**Discovery Phase**: Typically discovered in **Phase 5 (Monetization)** or during collections (post-event) when statements go unpaid.\n\n**Look Left** (what was missed before discovery):\n\n- **P4 → P3**: Could the rapid utilization spike be predicted? Yes, by tracking the ratio of overpayments or the frequency of credit limit increases shortly before the utilization event.\n- **P3**: Sudden changes to contact information combined with a recent limit increase is a leading indicator.\n\n**Look Right** (predicted next steps if uninterrupted):\n\n- The actor will abandon the identity and likely create new synthetic identities to repeat the cycle at other institutions.\n- The debt will roll into charge-off status.\n\n---\n\n## Controls & Mitigations\n\n| Phase | Control | Type | Owner |\n|-------|---------|------|-------|\n| P1 | Enhanced identity verification during onboarding | Preventive | Fraud Strategy |\n| P3 | \"Velocity\" checks on credit limit increase requests | Preventive | Credit Risk |\n| P3 | Alert on contact info changes preceding high-value draws | Detective | Fraud Ops |\n| P4 | Real-time monitoring for rapid utilization spikes (Sleep/Wake pattern) | Detective | Fraud Ops |\n| P5 | Block or review high-velocity cash advances | Preventive | Transaction Monitoring |\n\n---\n\n## Detection Approaches\n\n### Queries / Rules\n\n**SQL — Rapid Utilization Spike (Bust-Out Indicator)**\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    c.customer_id, \n    c.account_id, \n    c.credit_limit, \n    SUM(t.amount) as total_drawn,\n    (SUM(t.amount) / c.credit_limit) as utilization_ratio\nFROM credit_accounts c\nJOIN transactions t ON c.account_id = t.account_id\nWHERE t.transaction_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '3 days'\nGROUP BY 1, 2, 3\nHAVING SUM(t.amount) / c.credit_limit > 0.85 \n   AND c.account_age_days > 180 -- Established accounts\n   AND c.historical_avg_utilization < 0.30; -- Previously low-balance\n```\n\n### Behavioral Analytics\n\n- **Sleep/Wake Pattern Detection**: Alert on accounts that maintain low activity for 6+ months followed by a sudden burst of high-value transactions.\n- **Payment Behavior**: Flag instances of repeated overpayments (often using bad checks) meant to temporarily artificially inflate available credit.\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n- FLAME Project Internal Knowledge Base.\n- Industry typologies for First-Party and Synthetic Fraud.\n\n---\n\n## Revision History\n\n| Date | Author | Change |\n|------|--------|--------|\n| 2026-02-20 | FLAME Project | Initial creation |",
