  "body": "---\n\n## Summary\n\n\"Pig Butchering\" (Sha Zhu Pan) is an orchestrated, long-term social engineering scheme where perpetrators build trust with targets over weeks or months (often via dating apps or misdirected text messages) before convincing them to invest in fraudulent cryptocurrency platforms. The scam is characterized by an extended \"fattening\" phase where the victim sees fake returns on small initial investments, prompting them to invest massive sums before the platform disappears.\n\n---\n\n## Threat Path Hypothesis\n\n> **Hypothesis**: Threat actors will use social media, dating apps, or SMS to initiate contact, cultivate a romantic or friendly relationship, and gradually introduce the victim to a fraudulent investment platform, culminating in the victim voluntarily authorizing large transfers of funds or cryptocurrency that are ultimately stolen.\n\n**Confidence**: High — Widely documented by law enforcement globally, with billions of dollars in reported losses annually.\n\n**Estimated Impact**: Extremely high per victim. Often results in the victim liquidating life savings, taking out loans, or mortgaging property. Average losses range from $50k to $1M+.\n\n---\n\n## CFPF Phase Mapping\n\n### Phase 1: Recon\n\n| Technique | Description | Indicators |\n|-----------|-------------|------------|\n| CFPF-P1-003: Target identification | Actors source victim phone numbers or social media profiles from data brokers or breaches, initiating contact via \"wrong number\" texts or dating apps. | Inbound SMS from unknown international or VoIP numbers; rapid transition to encrypted messaging apps (WhatsApp, Telegram) |\n\n**Data Sources**: Telecommunications providers, user-reported SMS spam.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 2: Initial Access\n\n| Technique | Description | Indicators |\n|-----------|-------------|------------|\n| CFPF-P2-002: Vishing (voice phishing) / Texting | The actor establishes long-term rapport. No malicious links or overt requests for money are made initially. | (Not visible to financial institution, fully out-of-band social engineering) |\n\n**Data Sources**: Victim mobile devices, messaging platform metadata.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 3: Positioning\n\n| Technique | Description | Indicators |\n|-----------|-------------|------------|\n| CFPF-P3-001: Add authorized user / Introduce platform | The actor introduces the victim to a fake trading platform (often a sophisticated clone of a real exchange). The victim creates an account and links their legitimate bank account. | User downloads unverified trading apps (TestFlight/sideloaded); victim connects bank account to new crypto on-ramps |\n\n**Data Sources**: Mobile Device Management (MDM) if corporate, bank connection logs (Plaid/Yodlee).\n\n---\n\n### Phase 4: Execution\n\n| Technique | Description | Indicators |\n|-----------|-------------|------------|\n| CFPF-P4-001: Unauthorized wire transfer | (Authorized Push Payment) The victim transfers funds from their bank to a legitimate crypto exchange, converts to crypto, and sends it to the fraudulent platform's wallet. | Wire transfers or ACH to crypto exchanges (Coinbase, Kraken); liquidation of legitimate investment accounts followed by immediate transfer out |\n\n**Data Sources**: Bank wire logs, ACH monitoring, securities brokerage withdrawal logs.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 5: Monetization\n\n| Technique | Description | Indicators |\n|-----------|-------------|------------|\n| CFPF-P5-002: Rapid fund movement | The fraudulent platform shows fake profits. When the victim attempts a withdrawal, they are hit with \"tax\" or \"fee\" demands (further extortion). Eventually, the communications cease. | Blockchain transactions showing victim deposits flowing immediately to nested exchanges or mixers |\n\n**Data Sources**: Blockchain analytics platforms (Chainalysis, TRM), crypto exchange SARs.\n\n---\n\n## Evasion Techniques\n\n| Technique | Description | Detection Signal |\n|-----------|-------------|------------------|\n| Domain Sale Page Camouflage | Fraudulent investment platform domain shows \"for sale\" or \"coming soon\" page to automated scanners, evading blocklists while remaining operational for victims directed via messaging apps | FP-0007: `http_title` matches parked/sale pattern in domain_intel |\n| Geo-Targeted Content | Platform serves legitimate-looking content or blocks access from regions where law enforcement or researchers are likely based | Manual verification required; inconsistent scan results |\n\n**Source**: CrowdStrike Counter Adversary Operations — typosquatting evasion research.\n\n---\n\n## Look Left / Look Right Analysis\n\n**Discovery Phase**: Typically discovered at **Phase 5** when the victim reports the fraud because they cannot withdraw their purported \"profits.\"\n\n**Look Left**:\n\n- Financial institutions lack visibility into Phase 1-3.\n- The primary indicator at **Phase 4** is highly anomalous fund movements: e.g., an elderly customer who has never traded crypto suddenly wiring $100k to a crypto exchange.\n\n**Look Right**:\n\n- If untracked, victims will often apply for personal loans or home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) to fund \"fees\" to release their funds, compounding their financial ruin.\n\n---\n\n## Controls & Mitigations\n\n| Phase | Control | Type | Owner |\n|-------|---------|------|-------|\n| P1 | Telco-level SMS spam filtering for \"wrong number\" lures | Preventive | Telecommunications |\n| P4 | Dynamic friction/warnings on wires to crypto exchanges for vulnerable demographics | Preventive | Fraud Ops |\n| P4 | Flagging rapid loan origination followed immediately by wire out | Detective | Credit Risk / Fraud |\n| P5 | Blockchain monitoring to identify withdrawal addresses linked to known scam syndicates | Detective | Crypto Exchange AML |\n\n---\n\n## Detection Approaches\n\n### Queries / Rules\n\n**SQL — High-Value Outbound to Crypto Exchange (Elder Financial Exploitation Indicator)**\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    c.customer_id,\n    c.age,\n    w.wire_amount,\n    w.beneficiary_name,\n    w.wire_date\nFROM customers c\nJOIN wire_outbound w ON c.account_id = w.account_id\nWHERE c.age >= 60\n  AND w.wire_amount > 25000\n  AND w.beneficiary_name SIMILAR TO '%(coinbase|kraken|binance|gemini)%'\n  AND NOT EXISTS (\n      -- Detect if this is their first time wiring to crypto\n      SELECT 1 FROM wire_outbound w_old \n      WHERE w_old.account_id = c.account_id \n        AND w_old.wire_date < CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'\n        AND w_old.beneficiary_name SIMILAR TO '%(coinbase|kraken|binance|gemini)%'\n  );\n```\n\n### Behavioral Analytics\n\n- **Loan-to-Wire Velocity**: Analyze the latency between a customer taking out a new loan, HELOC, or liquidating a CD, and subsequently wiring those funds out. Rapid sequence (< 48 hours) highly indicative of Pig Butchering or other APP fraud.\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n- FinCEN Advisory on Pig Butchering (FIN-2023-A002).\n- FBI IC3 2023-2024 Cryptocurrency Fraud Reports.\n\n---\n\n## Revision History\n\n| Date | Author | Change |\n|------|--------|--------|\n| 2026-02-20 | FLAME Project | Initial creation |",
