  "body": "## Summary\n\nActors social-engineer mobile carriers to transfer a victim's phone number to an actor-controlled SIM card, then use intercepted SMS-based MFA codes to take over cryptocurrency exchange accounts and drain digital assets. FBI IC3 reported $68M+ in SIM swap losses in 2021 alone, with individual losses frequently exceeding $1M for high-net-worth crypto holders. DOJ has prosecuted multiple SIM swap rings targeting crypto investors specifically.\n\n## Threat Path Hypothesis\n\n> **Hypothesis**: Actors are targeting high-value cryptocurrency holders through SIM swap attacks at mobile carriers, using intercepted MFA codes to bypass exchange security and drain digital wallets, then laundering proceeds through mixing services and cross-chain bridges.\n\n**Confidence**: High — extensive DOJ prosecution history, FBI IC3 data, confirmed attack chains.\n**Estimated Impact**: $50,000 – $10,000,000+ per victim. Crypto's irreversibility makes recovery near-impossible.\n\n## CFPF Phase Mapping\n\n### Phase 1: Recon\n\n| Technique | Description | Indicators |\n|-----------|-------------|------------|\n| CFPF-P1-005: Social media recon | Identify crypto holders through social media posts (trading screenshots, NFT displays, conference attendance, Discord/Telegram group membership) | Scraping of crypto-focused social media; monitoring of blockchain conference attendee lists |\n| CFPF-P1-004: Dark web acquisition | Purchase victim PII (SSN, DOB, account PINs, carrier account details) from dark web markets or data broker leaks | PII packages for sale referencing crypto investors |\n| Carrier employee recruitment | Bribe or recruit insiders at mobile carriers to execute SIM swaps without standard verification | Carrier insider activity outside normal patterns |\n\n### Phase 2: Initial Access\n\n| Technique | Description | Indicators |\n|-----------|-------------|------------|\n| CFPF-P2-006: SIM swap | Contact mobile carrier impersonating victim (or via bribed insider) to port phone number to new SIM. Victim's phone immediately loses service. | Victim reports sudden loss of cellular service; unauthorized SIM change on carrier records |\n| SMS MFA interception | With phone number controlled, receive all SMS-based MFA codes for victim's accounts | MFA codes delivered to new device; login attempts immediately following SIM swap |\n| CFPF-P2-005: Credential access | Use previously obtained credentials (phishing, breach data, social engineering) combined with intercepted MFA to authenticate to exchange | Login from new device/IP with valid credentials + MFA |\n\n### Phase 3: Positioning\n\n| Technique | Description | Indicators |\n|-----------|-------------|------------|\n| CFPF-P3-003: Contact info modification | Change email, phone, and recovery options on exchange account to actor-controlled addresses | Account recovery contact changes immediately after login from new device |\n| CFPF-P3-005: New MFA device | Enroll actor-controlled authenticator app, disable SMS MFA | MFA device changes following SIM swap window |\n| API key creation | Generate API keys for programmatic access to exchange account (enables faster, automated withdrawals) | New API key creation from anomalous session |\n\n### Phase 4: Execution\n\n| Technique | Description | Indicators |\n|-----------|-------------|------------|\n| Cryptocurrency withdrawal | Drain all exchange balances — spot holdings, staking positions, DeFi deposits — to actor-controlled wallets | Maximum withdrawal activity; withdrawals to previously unused addresses; withdrawal of all asset types simultaneously |\n| NFT transfer | Transfer high-value NFTs to actor wallets | NFT transfers to new wallets during same session as crypto withdrawals |\n\n### Phase 5: Monetization\n\n| Technique | Description | Indicators |\n|-----------|-------------|------------|\n| CFPF-P5-003: Crypto laundering | Funds routed through mixing services (Tornado Cash, Sinbad), cross-chain bridges, or chain-hopping (BTC → Monero → BTC) | Transactions to known mixer addresses; rapid cross-chain transfers; peel chain patterns |\n| Peer-to-peer off-ramping | Convert crypto to fiat through P2P OTC desks, LocalBitcoins-style platforms, or international exchanges with weak KYC | Fiat withdrawals at exchanges in low-oversight jurisdictions |\n\n## Underground Ecosystem Context\n\n### Service Supply Chain\n| Role | Service Type | Underground Availability | Typical Cost Range |\n|------|-------------|--------------------------|-------------------|\n| PII Sourcer | Fullz shops providing name, SSN, DOB, address, phone | High | $5-$200 per fullz |\n| Carrier Insider | Corrupt mobile carrier employees performing unauthorized SIM swaps | Medium | $500-$5,000 per swap |\n| Social Engineer | Caller impersonating account holder to carrier support | High | $100-$500 per successful swap |\n| SIM Swap Service Operator | End-to-end SIM swap execution as a service | Medium | $300-$1,500 per target |\n| OTP Interception | Services that capture one-time passwords post-swap | High | Bundled with swap service |\n| Crypto Cashout | Rapid exchange conversion and tumbling services | High | 5-15% of stolen assets |\n\n### Tool Ecosystem\nOSINT tools for target reconnaissance (PII aggregators, social media scrapers), carrier account lookup tools, call spoofing services, VoIP platforms for social engineering calls, cryptocurrency wallet drainers, automated exchange withdrawal tools, SIM cloning hardware (less common than social engineering approach).\n\n### Underground Marketplace Presence\nSIM swap services are actively advertised on Telegram channels, dark web forums, and closed Discord/Telegram groups specializing in crypto theft. Carrier insider recruitment occurs on dedicated channels with regional specificity (specific carriers targeted based on known insider availability). Pricing follows a tiered model — basic social engineering swaps at the lower end, confirmed insider-assisted swaps commanding premium prices. The SIM swap to crypto ATO pipeline is a well-documented and commoditized attack chain.\n\n### Intelligence Sources\n- Recorded Future \"Business of Fraud\" (CTA-2021-0225) — SIM swap pricing and supply chain\n- FBI PIN 2022-0305-001 — SIM swapping and MFA bypass\n- CISA Advisory on SIM swap mitigation\n- Princeton University \"An Empirical Study of Wireless Carrier Authentication\"\n\n## Controls & Mitigations\n\n| Phase | Control | Type |\n|-------|---------|------|\n| P1 | Carrier account PIN/passphrase (set on mobile account to prevent unauthorized SIM changes) | Preventive |\n| P1 | Carrier port-freeze / number lock | Preventive |\n| P2 | **Never use SMS-based MFA for high-value accounts** — hardware keys (YubiKey) or authenticator apps only | Preventive |\n| P3 | Exchange: flag and hold withdrawals when account recovery contacts change within 24-48hrs of login | Detective |\n| P4 | Exchange: mandatory 24-72hr withdrawal hold for new devices/IPs | Preventive |\n| P4 | Exchange: withdrawal address whitelisting with time-lock on additions | Preventive |\n| P5 | Blockchain analytics: flag transactions to known mixer/tumbler addresses | Detective |\n\n## Detection Approaches\n\n**Exchange-Side — SIM Swap Indicator Correlation**\n\n```sigma\ntitle: New Device Login After SIM Swap\nstatus: experimental\ndescription: Detects a new device login following a recently detected SIM and MFA change.\nlogsource:\n    category: application\n    product: exchange_platform\ndetection:\n    selection_login:\n        EventName: 'UserLogin'\n        DeviceIsNew: true\n    selection_mfa:\n        EventName: 'MFAMethodChanged'\n    selection_contact:\n        EventName: 'ContactInfoChanged'\n    selection_withdraw:\n        EventName: 'CryptoWithdrawal'\n        AddressIsNew: true\n    timeframe: 24h\n    condition: selection_login and selection_mfa and selection_contact and selection_withdraw\n```\n\n**Carrier-Side — Anomalous SIM Change Detection**\n\n```\nFlag SIM changes where:\n  - Change requested through non-standard channel (call center vs. retail)\n  - Change followed by immediate account activity at financial services\n  - Customer has no prior SIM change history\n  - Multiple SIM changes across different customers by same representative\n```\n\n## References\n\n- FBI IC3 PSA: \"SIM Swapping\"\n- DOJ: \"Eight Individuals Charged in SIM Swap Conspiracy\" (various indictments)\n- Chainalysis: Crypto Crime Report (annual)\n- T-Mobile, AT&T carrier SIM swap prevention documentation\n\n## Revision History\n\n| Date | Author | Change |\n|------|--------|--------|\n| 2026-02-12 | FLAME Project | Initial submission |",
