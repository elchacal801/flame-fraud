  "body": "---\n\n## Summary\n\nDeepfake document fraud targets the Know Your Customer (KYC) and remote account onboarding processes. Criminals utilize advanced generative AI models (GANs, diffusion models) to manufacture highly realistic, synthetic identifying documents (e.g., driver's licenses, passports, utility bills) that match the details of a synthetic or stolen identity. This bypasses automated optical character recognition (OCR) and facial recognition checks used by financial institutions during self-service digital onboarding.\n\n---\n\n## Threat Path Hypothesis\n\n> **Hypothesis**: Threat actors leverage low-cost, publicly available generative AI tooling to create photo-realistic identity documents that can defeat automated remote identity verification controls, allowing them to open vast numbers of fraudulent accounts with stolen or synthetic PII for downstream exploitation (mule networks or bust-outs).\n\n**Confidence**: High — Widely observed accelerating trend across the fintech and banking sector. Vendors specializing in document verification report a massive spike in deepfake ID submissions.\n\n**Estimated Impact**: Initial impact is creating a \"sleeper\" account. The downstream impact (when the account is used for muling or bust-outs) ranges from thousands to millions of dollars. The primary issue is the sheer volume and velocity enabled by automated generation.\n\n---\n\n## CFPF Phase Mapping\n\n### Phase 1: Recon\n\n| Technique | Description | Indicators |\n|-----------|-------------|------------|\n| CFPF-P1-001: Tool acquisition | Threat actors source AI generation tools (often via Telegram or dark web forums like \"OnlyFakes\") that specifically specialize in template-based generation of KYC documents. | (External to financial institution) |\n\n**Data Sources**: Dark web monitoring, specialized cyber threat intelligence.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 2: Initial Access\n\n| Technique | Description | Indicators |\n|-----------|-------------|------------|\n| CFPF-P2-001: Remote Account Opening | The actor attempts to open a new digital account using the AI-generated document and a live-injected or deepfake video selfie to bypass liveness checks. | Micro-anomalies in uploaded photo or video (lighting inconsistencies, blurring around text, unnatural facial movements in liveness checks); matching Exif metadata across supposedly distinct applicants. |\n\n**Data Sources**: Document verification vendor logs, KYC metadata, webcam/camera feed metrics.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 3: Positioning\n\n| Technique | Description | Indicators |\n|-----------|-------------|------------|\n| CFPF-P3-001: Sleeper Account Maturation | Accounts successfully created with deepfake documents are allowed to \"age\" to bypass neo-account restrictions before being sold as drop accounts. | Initial funding of account with bare minimum amounts; subsequent dormancy for 30-90 days. |\n\n**Data Sources**: Account activity monitoring, login frequency analytics.\n\n---\n\n## Look Left / Look Right Analysis\n\n**Discovery Phase**: Frequently discovered at **Phase 2** if the document vendor has robust AI detection, or later at **Phase 5** when the account is flagged for money laundering or bust-out behavior.\n\n**Look Left**:\n\n- Could document verification metadata have flagged the anomaly earlier? Frequently, the deepfake images lack normal physical artifacts (lens distortion, natural shadows) or contain AI-specific artifacts.\n- Analysis of application velocity from similar device fingerprints or IP ranges.\n\n**Look Right**:\n\n- If untracked, these accounts populate the institution's customer base with dormant \"sleeper cells\" ready to be activated for massive money mule networks or organized loan fraud.\n\n---\n\n## Underground Ecosystem Context\n\n### Service Supply Chain\n| Role | Service Type | Underground Availability | Typical Cost Range |\n|------|-------------|--------------------------|-------------------|\n| Document Forger | AI-generated identity documents (passports, licenses, utility bills) | High | $5-$50 per document |\n| Face Swap Provider | Real-time face-swapping tools for KYC liveness bypass | High | Free (open-source) to $200/month (commercial) |\n| Camera Injection Specialist | Virtual camera tools that inject synthetic video into verification flows | Medium | $20-$100 per tool license |\n| Device Spoofing | Modified apps, emulators, and VM setups for device fingerprint evasion | High | $50-$200 per setup kit |\n| Network Anonymization | Residential proxy services for geolocation matching | High | $5-$30/day per residential IP |\n| End-to-End KYC Bypass | Full-service KYC bypass combining all above steps | Low | $200-$1,000 per verified account |\n\n### Tool Ecosystem\nAI document generation tools (template-based and GAN-based), face-swapping applications (17+ tools identified in WEF evaluation, ranging from free open-source to commercial SaaS), camera injection/virtual camera tools (8+ tools identified), device emulators and modified mobile apps, residential proxy networks, automated KYC submission frameworks.\n\n### Underground Marketplace Presence\nDeepfake KYC bypass services are actively advertised on Telegram channels specializing in financial fraud, dark web marketplaces, and carding forums. The market has stratified into component sellers (document-only, face-swap-only) and full-service providers offering end-to-end account opening. Pricing inversely correlates with target institution's IDV sophistication. Crypto exchange accounts command premium prices due to monetization potential.\n\n### Intelligence Sources\n- WEF \"Deepfake Identity Verification\" (January 2026) — comprehensive tool ecosystem evaluation\n- Recorded Future deepfake marketplace monitoring\n- Document verification vendor threat reports (Onfido, Socure, ID R&D)\n- INTERPOL reports on AI-enabled identity fraud\n\n---\n\n## Controls & Mitigations\n\n| Phase | Control | Type | Owner |\n|-------|---------|------|-------|\n| P2 | Active/Passive Liveness Detection (requiring specific physical responses) | Preventive | KYC/Onboarding |\n| P2 | Injection Attack Prevention (preventing virtual cameras from feeding the onboarding flow) | Preventive | Digital Channels |\n| P2 | Specialized deepfake detection algorithms (spectral analysis of images) | Detective | Fraud Strategy |\n| P3 | Sleeper Account Monitoring (flagging sudden activity after 90 days of dormancy) | Detective | Transaction Monitoring |\n| P1 | Assessment of IDV vendor deepfake detection capabilities (face swap + injection attack coverage) | Preventive | KYC/Onboarding |\n| P2 | Device integrity checks (detect virtual cameras, emulators, modified apps) | Preventive | Digital Channels |\n| P2 | Network analysis (flag residential proxy patterns, VPN usage during onboarding) | Detective | Fraud Strategy |\n| P3 | Cross-vendor verification for high-risk applications (second IDV provider check) | Detective | Fraud Strategy |\n\n---\n\n## UCFF Alignment\n\n### Required Organizational Maturity for Effective Detection\n\n| UCFF Domain | Minimum Maturity | Key Deliverables for This Threat Path |\n|-------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|\n| COMMIT | Level 3 (Established) | Executive investment in document verification technology upgrades and AI-based detection capabilities;

The paper evaluated 17 face-swapping tools and 8 camera injection tools, confirming that the attack toolchain is mature, accessible, and rapidly improving.\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n- FLAME Project Internal Knowledge Base.\n- Document Verification Industry Reports (e.g., Onfido, Socure, ID R&D regarding GenAI threats).\n- World Economic Forum: \"Deepfake Identity Verification\" (January 2026) — three-stage KYC attack methodology and tool ecosystem evaluation\n\n---\n\n## Revision History\n\n| Date | Author | Change |\n|------|--------|--------|\n| 2026-02-20 | FLAME Project | Initial creation |\n| 2026-02-28 | FLAME Project | v1.5 enrichment: added Stripe FT3 tactic mappings, UCFF Alignment section, Underground Ecosystem Context, WEF deepfake intelligence |",
