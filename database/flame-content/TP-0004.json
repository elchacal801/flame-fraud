  "body": "## Summary\n\nActors compromise employee self-service HR portals (Workday, ADP, UKG, etc.) to change direct deposit routing information, diverting paychecks to actor-controlled accounts. Often combined with email rule manipulation to suppress payroll notifications. FBI IC3 flagged this as a growing BEC variant. Low per-incident amounts ($2,000-$10,000) but high volume and often undetected for multiple pay cycles.\n\n## Threat Path Hypothesis\n\n> **Hypothesis**: Actors are using credential phishing targeting employees to access self-service HR portals and modify direct deposit information, diverting payroll payments to prepaid card or mule accounts, exploiting the gap between HR systems and fraud monitoring.\n\n**Confidence**: High — FBI PSA, multiple confirmed campaigns across industries.\n**Estimated Impact**: $2,000 – $10,000 per employee per pay cycle. Campaigns may target dozens of employees at a single organization.\n\n## CFPF Phase Mapping\n\n### Phase 1: Recon\n\n| Technique | Description | Indicators |\n|-----------|-------------|------------|\n| CFPF-P1-005: Social media recon | Identify target organization's HR portal vendor (often visible on employee LinkedIn profiles or corporate job postings) | N/A |\n| CFPF-P1-003: Lookalike domain | Register domains mimicking HR portal login pages (e.g., `workday-login-[company].com`) | Domain registrations containing HR vendor names + target company |\n\n### Phase 2: Initial Access\n\n| Technique | Description | Indicators |\n|-----------|-------------|------------|\n| CFPF-P2-004: Email phishing | Send phishing emails impersonating HR department — \"Update your direct deposit for tax season\" / \"Verify your benefits enrollment\" / \"Action required: payroll system migration\" | Phishing emails referencing HR portal by name; credential harvesting pages mimicking specific HR vendor |\n| CFPF-P2-005: Credential stuffing | Use breached credentials to access HR portals (many employees reuse personal passwords for corporate self-service) | Failed login spikes on HR portal; successful logins from anomalous locations |\n\n### Phase 3: Positioning\n\n| Technique | Description | Indicators |\n|-----------|-------------|------------|\n| Direct deposit modification | Change bank routing and account number for direct deposit to actor-controlled account | Deposit changes from new IPs/devices; changes outside enrollment windows; multiple employees changing deposits in short period |\n| CFPF-P3-003: Modify contact info | Change email or phone to prevent employee from receiving payroll deposit confirmations | Contact info changes correlated with deposit changes |\n| Tax form harvesting | Download W-2s, pay stubs, or tax documents for identity theft (secondary objective) | Document downloads from unusual sessions |\n\n### Phase 4: Execution\n\n| Technique | Description | Indicators |\n|-----------|-------------|------------|\n| CFPF-P4-005: Payroll diversion | Next payroll cycle processes with modified direct deposit info, sending employee's pay to actor's account | ACH credits to newly specified account; deposit to account with no prior relationship to employee |\n\n### Phase 5: Monetization\n\n| Technique | Description | Indicators |\n|-----------|-------------|------------|\n| CFPF-P5-005: Prepaid card loading | Funds deposited to prepaid debit cards, rapidly withdrawn or spent | Payroll ACH deposits to prepaid card programs |\n| CFPF-P5-004: Cash withdrawal | Rapid ATM withdrawals from mule accounts receiving diverted payroll | Full-balance withdrawals within hours of payroll deposit |\n\n## Look Left / Look Right\n\n**Discovery Phase**: Typically **P4** — employee notices missing direct deposit, usually 1-3 days after payday. Sometimes not discovered until next pay cycle if employee doesn't check promptly.\n\n**Look Left**: Were there phishing emails targeting employees in the days/weeks before? Did the HR portal show login anomalies? Were multiple employees at the same organization targeted (campaign-level indicator)?\n\n**Look Right**: Were W-2s or tax documents also harvested (identity theft)? Are the same mule accounts receiving diverted payroll from multiple organizations?\n\n## Controls & Mitigations\n\n| Phase | Control | Type |\n|-------|---------|------|\n| P2 | Phishing-resistant MFA on HR self-service portals | Preventive |\n| P3 | Out-of-band confirmation (email + SMS to original contact info) for any direct deposit change | Preventive |\n| P3 | Lockout period: no direct deposit changes within 48hrs of contact info changes | Preventive |\n| P3 | HR/IT alert: flag multiple employees changing direct deposit in same time window | Detective |\n| P4 | Payroll team review of all deposit routing changes before processing | Preventive |\n\n## Detection Approaches\n\n**Sigma — Multiple Direct Deposit Changes from Anomalous Source**\n\n```yaml\ntitle: HR Portal - Bulk Direct Deposit Modifications\nstatus: experimental\ndescription: Multiple employees modifying direct deposit within short window from unusual IPs\nlogsource:\n    product: hr_portal\n    service: audit\ndetection:\n    selection:\n        action: \"modify_direct_deposit\"\n    timeframe: 72h\n    condition: selection | count(distinct employee_id) by source_ip > 3\nlevel: critical\ntags:\n    - cfpf.phase3.positioning\n```\n\n## References\n\n- FBI IC3 PSA I-091819-PSA: \"Cybercriminals Use Social Engineering and Technical Attacks to Circumvent Multi-Factor Authentication\"\n- FBI IC3 PSA: \"Business Email Compromise: Payroll Diversion\"\n- KnowBe4: Payroll Diversion Phishing Trends\n\n## Revision History\n\n| Date | Author | Change |\n|------|--------|--------|\n| 2026-02-12 | FLAME Project | Initial submission |",
