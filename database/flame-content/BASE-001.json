  "body": "## Description\n\nThis baseline document defines the \"normal\" operating parameters for commercial wire transfers within the SME (Small to Medium Enterprise) banking sector, used to contextualize detection rules for TP-0002 (BEC), TP-0019 (Business Identity Theft), and TP-0020 (Supply Chain Payment Fraud).\n\n## Normal Patterns\n\n* **Approval Latency:** The average time between wire initiation and secondary approval is typically **2-4 hours** during business days. Approvals executed within < 10 seconds of initiation represent high anomalous velocity (indicative of ATO or collusive insider).\n* **Beneficiary Novelty:** For established businesses (> 1 year old), **85%** of weekly outbound wire volume is directed to existing, historical beneficiaries.\n* **Volume Spikes:** Normal accounts exhibit a standard deviation of no more than **200%** week-over-week in total outbound volume, unless preceded by a corresponding inbound funding event.\n\n## Application to Detection\n\nDetection rules should use these baselines to set thresholds. For instance, a rule looking for \"abnormal volume\" should trigger at >3 standard deviations (or >300% WoW increase) to drastically reduce false positives.",
